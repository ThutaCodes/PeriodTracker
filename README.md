# Period Tracker

Live demo [https://electricg.github.io/period-tracker/](https://electricg.github.io/period-tracker/)

## Why

- I wanted to play with some of the cool new browser API (service workers, add to home screen, background sync, etc...)
- I wanted a light app that does exactly what I need with only a couple of tap
- I wanted the data to be easy to backup and retrieve

## Features

- Work offline using service worker [more info](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/)
- Add to Home screen [more info](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/increasing-engagement-with-app-install-banners-in-chrome-for-android?hl=en)
- Export to and import from file
- Share data to other apps
